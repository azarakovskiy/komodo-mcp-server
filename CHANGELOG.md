# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

--------------------------------------------------------------
## [1.6.0]

### Added

- **Unattended service-account access over the network.** New opt-in
  `MCP_ALLOW_SHARED_CREDENTIAL_WRITES` (`[access].allow_shared_credential_writes`, default `false`).
  On an auth-disabled `http`/`https` server, anonymous callers can now be granted the full tool
  surface - writes, exec, deletes - acting as the shared `[komodo]` identity, exactly like `stdio`.
  This keeps clients connected that cannot complete a browser login and cannot hold a token, such as
  scheduled agents. Ignored while authentication is enabled; fails closed to read-only when no shared
  credentials are configured; startup logs a security warning and a `config.open_full_access` audit
  event while it is in effect.
- **Destructive tools still confirm.** The opt-in does not bypass [destructive-action confirmation](config/README.md#destructive-action-confirmation) -
  unattended clients that cannot answer an elicitation prompt need `MCP_CONFIRM_FALLBACK=allow`.

> **Security note:** with this flag an open server is no longer bounded to reads - every client that
> can reach the endpoint gets the Komodo permissions of the configured API key. Use a dedicated,
> least-privilege Komodo service user and restrict the endpoint to a trusted network.

--------------------------------------------------------------
## [1.5.0]

The main themes: **sign in with your own Komodo account**, **secure by default** over the network,
**safer** destructive actions, and a **cleaner, unified configuration**.

> **Upgrade notes**
> - **Login is now required by default** over HTTP/HTTPS - clients must sign in with a Komodo
>   username and password. To keep the old open behavior, set `MCP_AUTH_ENABLED=false` (an open
>   network server then runs **read-only**). Local `stdio` is unaffected.
> - **Some settings from earlier releases were renamed** - update them if you use them:
>   the env vars `API_TIMEOUT_MS` -> `KOMODO_API_TIMEOUT_MS` and `KOMODO_RESOURCE_*` -> `MCP_RESOURCE_*`,
>   and in the **config file** the `[logging].dir` key is now `[logging].log_dir` (the `LOG_DIR`
>   environment variable is unchanged). See the [configuration reference](config/README.md).
> - The `komodo_configure` tool was removed (see Removed).

### Added

- **More tools: Docker introspection, builders, tags, and TOML export.** 19 new tools —
  inspect Docker images/networks/volumes per server (`komodo_docker_*`), manage Builders
  (`komodo_builder_*`, so you can attach one to a build), manage Tags (`komodo_tag_*`), and export your
  resources as sync TOML (`komodo_toml_export_*`). Adapted from **ATreemanDork**'s
  `komodo-mcp-server_extended` fork — thank you! Read tools respect the read-only-when-open rule;
  writes require the appropriate permission and confirm before deleting.
- **Sign in with your own Komodo account.** Over HTTP/HTTPS each person logs in with their own Komodo
  username and password and gets their own session with their own permissions, instead of everyone
  sharing a single connection. (External Google/GitHub/OIDC login is planned, not in this release.)
- **Choose which tools are available.** Limit the tool list to restrict what the assistant can do
  (for example read-only, or no terminal access) and to keep the list small:
  `MCP_TOOLS_ALLOWED_CATEGORIES`, `MCP_TOOLS_EXCLUDED_CATEGORIES`, `MCP_TOOLS_EXCLUDED_TOOLS`. See the
  [configuration reference](config/README.md).
- **Server branding.** MCP clients that support it now show the server's name and the Komodo logo.
- **Public URL setting for reverse-proxy/domain setups.** Set `MCP_BASE_URL` (for example
  `https://mcp.example.com`) so sign-in links and OAuth redirects use the address clients actually
  reach - not the internal bind host/port. That host is also trusted automatically, so you don't have
  to repeat it in the allowed-hosts list.

### Security

- **Authentication is on by default** for HTTP/HTTPS - clients must sign in (see Upgrade notes). To
  run without it, set `MCP_AUTH_ENABLED=false`.
- **An open network server is read-only.** If you turn authentication off on HTTP/HTTPS, anonymous
  callers get read/list tools only - write, delete and terminal tools (including `komodo_exec`) are
  hidden and refused. Local `stdio` stays fully capable. Hardens advisory GHSA-gf32-w3f6-crx6.
- **Secrets are hidden from tool output.** API keys, tokens, secret variables, webhook URLs and
  similar values are automatically removed from results before they reach the assistant or the chat
  transcript - including terminal and log output, and the TOML export. On by default
  (`MCP_SECRET_SCRUB_ENABLED`); best-effort, so don't treat it as your only safeguard. (The
  create-API-key tool still returns its key on purpose.)
- **The TOML export no longer hands out secrets.** `komodo_toml_export_all` and
  `komodo_toml_export_resources` are read tools, so they are available even on an open, read-only
  server - but their output was only being redacted with plain text matching, which missed secret
  variable values, server passkeys and alerter webhook URLs, and which mangled the `is_secret` flag
  so the exported file no longer parsed. Komodo itself only masks variable values, and only for
  non-admins, so nothing else was catching this. The export is now redacted properly and stays valid
  TOML. Because the values are masked, treat the export as something to read and diff rather than to
  re-apply as-is, and the `secrets_masked` field now tells you truthfully whether redaction ran.
- **Destructive actions ask first.** Deletes, `destroy`, prune, terminal commands, and
  procedure/action/sync runs now require your confirmation before running - a single approve click, no
  extra checkbox. On by default; tune with `MCP_CONFIRM_DESTRUCTIVE` and `MCP_CONFIRM_FALLBACK` (clients
  that can't show a prompt may need `MCP_CONFIRM_FALLBACK=allow`). The prompt now waits up to 5 minutes
  for your answer, adjustable with `MCP_CONFIRM_TIMEOUT_MS` (e.g. `30s`, `5m`, `1h`).
- **Per-user permissions are enforced.** A signed-in user can only act on the Komodo resources their
  account allows; anything else fails fast with a clear error instead of a raw Komodo failure. This
  now also covers **creating** resources and **managing variables** - previously those were sent
  straight to Komodo, so you got a bare "forbidden" back instead of a useful message. The checks
  mirror Komodo's own rules and never refuse something Komodo would have allowed.
- **A complete audit trail.** The audit log now records, for each tool call, what was requested, which
  resources were affected, and the outcome - with a shared request id linking an action to its
  permission and confirmation entries. Secrets are stripped first. Tune how much request/result detail
  is kept with `LOG_AUDIT_TOOL_IO` (`off` / `summary` / `full`; default `summary`).

### Changed

- **Read tools return a useful summary by default.** Large results (inspect, logs, full resources) are
  offloaded to a session resource and the tool returns a concise summary of the key facts - for example
  a container inspect now shows its state and image, not just its name. Pass `inline_full: true` to get
  the entire result inline instead. This now works over **local `stdio` too** - previously the full
  payload was still dumped inline there, which is exactly where most clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor)
  connect. A container inspect went from ~9,700 characters of chat context down to ~160 plus a link
  the client fetches only if it needs the detail.
- **You only see the tools you may actually use.** When signed in, the tool list is now filtered by your
  own Komodo permissions - a read-only account no longer sees the write, delete and terminal tools it
  would only ever get refused on. Fewer irrelevant tools also means a smaller, cheaper prompt for the
  assistant. Local `stdio` is unchanged (one local user, full list), and an open server without
  authentication keeps showing exactly the read-only set it already did.
- **Unified configuration.** Every setting now works both as an environment variable and in the
  config file (TOML/YAML/JSON), with consistent naming - `KOMODO_*` for the Komodo connection, `MCP_*`
  for the server's own behavior. Time settings accept plain-language durations (`30s`, `5m`, `1h`) as
  well as milliseconds. Some keys were renamed (see Upgrade notes). The example configs and the
  [configuration reference](config/README.md) document the full, current set of settings.
- **The generic redaction settings now work too.** The underlying server framework has its own
  `MCP_SCRUB_ENABLED`, `MCP_SCRUB_ADDITIONAL_KEYS` and `MCP_SCRUB_ALLOW_KEYS`, which previously had no
  effect here. They now act as the base layer, and Komodo's `MCP_SECRET_SCRUB_*` settings extend it -
  extra key names from both are combined, and if you set the Komodo switch it wins. Setting nothing
  keeps redaction on, as before.

### Fixed

- **Better compatibility with MCP clients** during connection setup: the server now negotiates the
  MCP protocol version the way the spec intends, so newer clients (e.g. MCP Inspector v2) connect
  cleanly instead of failing the handshake.
- **Lists no longer cut off at the first page** on Komodo Core 2.3+
  ([#174](https://github.com/MP-Tool/komodo-mcp-server/issues/174)): list tools now fetch the complete
  set instead of silently returning only the first ~50 items. Also updated for Core 2.3's renamed
  container APIs while staying compatible with Core 2.0-2.3+.
- **Paging through the update history no longer skips entries.** `komodo_update_list` handed out your
  requested page size but then jumped a whole Komodo page forward, so most of every page was
  unreachable - asking for 25 at a time silently skipped 75 of every 100 entries. Paging now walks the
  history completely and in order. Its default page size is also 25 now, matching every other list
  tool. Cursors from an older version keep working.
- **Clear "please upgrade" message** when a tool needs a newer Komodo core, instead of a cryptic error
  (generalizes [#151](https://github.com/MP-Tool/komodo-mcp-server/pull/151), thanks @jjsmackay).
  Terminal exec and Docker Swarm tools require Core 2.0+.
- **`komodo_exec` returns the real output** on containers, deployments and stack services - it
  previously returned the echoed command with no exit code
  ([#159](https://github.com/MP-Tool/komodo-mcp-server/pull/159), thanks @jjsmackay).
- **Listing and update tools handle "not set yet" values**
  ([#158](https://github.com/MP-Tool/komodo-mcp-server/pull/158), thanks @sai-roda): actions and
  procedures that never ran, in-progress updates, and swarm service replicas no longer cause an error,
  and update pagination no longer loops on the last page.

### Removed

- **`komodo_configure` tool.** The Komodo connection is now set only at startup (config file or
  `KOMODO_*` env vars) or via per-user login - it can no longer be changed from a chat tool. Use
  `komodo_health_check` to check the connection status.

## [1.4.1] - Fixes tools and update dependencies

### Fixed

- **`komodo_exec` — `target: "server"` failed with HTTP 500 on Komodo Core v2** ([#135](https://github.com/MP-Tool/komodo-mcp-server/issues/135)): Running a command on a server target always returned an error. The terminal session was not being initialised before the command was sent, which Komodo v2 requires. The `shell` parameter (default `sh`) now also applies to `target: "server"`, consistent with the other targets.
- **`komodo_exec` — exit code was always missing or showed `%d` instead of a number** ([#135](https://github.com/MP-Tool/komodo-mcp-server/issues/135)): The exit code reported by Komodo was not being recognised correctly, so `exit_code` was always `null` for server targets and sometimes showed the raw placeholder `%d` for container/deployment/stack targets. Both cases are now handled and invalid values are returned as `null`.
- **`komodo_exec` — `target: "server"` returned garbled output instead of the command result** ([#135](https://github.com/MP-Tool/komodo-mcp-server/issues/135)): Instead of showing the actual command output, the response contained internal protocol markers from Komodo. Caused by a known issue in Komodo Periphery where the terminal echoes the command scaffold back into the output stream before the real output arrives. Fixed client-side; a separate bug report has been filed with the Komodo project.
- **`komodo_user_delete_api_key` — deleting by key name returned HTTP 404**: The tool expected the raw `K_...` key string, but a name like `"test"` was a natural and expected input. When the name was passed, Komodo returned 404 because it could not find a key matching that identifier. The tool now accepts either the key name or the full `K_...` string. If a name is provided, it is resolved to the key string via `ListApiKeys` before deletion. If multiple keys share the same name, the tool asks for the full key string to avoid ambiguity.

### Dependencies
- Bumped: mcp-server-framework from 1.1.0 to 1.1.2, qs from 6.15.1 to 6.15.2, typescript-eslint from 8.59.3 to 8.59.4, @grpc/grpc-js from 1.14.3 to 1.14.4, hono from 4.12.18 to 4.12.26 and all other dependencies to their latest versions for security and stability

## [1.4.0] - Full Komodo Coverage & Context Efficiency

A major release focused on **breadth, clarity and context efficiency**. The tool surface grew from 51 to **70 tools across 16 categories** and now covers every Komodo resource type — Builds, Repos, Procedures, Actions, Alerters, Docker Swarms, Variables, Resource Syncs and the Update audit log — while large payloads no longer flood your AI assistant's context window.

### Highlights

- 🧰 **Full Komodo coverage** — Manage every Komodo resource from your AI assistant: containers, servers, stacks, deployments, builds, repos, procedures, actions, alerters, Docker Swarms (Komodo v2), variables, resource syncs and the audit log.
- 🪶 **Smaller context, faster answers** — Big responses (`inspect`, `info`, `logs`, `search_logs`) are no longer dumped into the chat. They live as session-scoped resources your client fetches on demand. Pass `inline_full: true` to opt out.
- 📑 **Cursor pagination on every list** — Stop pulling thousands of containers, deployments or update entries into a single response. Default page size is 50 (1–100), and a `next_cursor` lets your assistant page through results without overwhelming the LLM.
- 📊 **Typed responses for both humans and LLMs** — Every read tool now returns rich Markdown (state badges, formatted logs, exec output) for the user *and* a typed `structuredContent` payload for the LLM. Modern clients render both; legacy clients see clean Markdown.
- 🪝 **Consistent tool names** — All tools follow `komodo_<domain>_<action>` (e.g. `komodo_container_list`, `komodo_server_info`). Easier to remember, easier to teach your AI assistant.
- 📂 **Categories & RBAC scopes** — Every tool carries a `_meta.category` (16 categories) and `requiredScopes` (`komodo:read` / `komodo:operate` / `komodo:admin`), so MCP gateways and clients can filter or gate tools cleanly.

### Added

#### New resource domains

- **Builds (6 tools)** — List, inspect, run, cancel, fetch logs and create/update/delete Komodo Builds. The `run` tool reports live progress while the build executes.
- **Repos (5 tools)** — List, inspect and create/update/delete Komodo Repos plus a single `komodo_repo_action` covering `clone` / `pull` / `build` / `cancel_build`.
- **Procedures (5 tools)** — Run and manage multi-stage Komodo Procedures, with live per-stage progress reporting while a procedure executes.
- **Actions (5 tools)** — Run, cancel and manage Komodo Actions (KomodoTS scripts). Live progress for `run`.
- **Alerters (4 tools)** — List, inspect and create/update/delete Komodo Alerter sinks (Slack, Discord, Pushover, Custom HTTP …).
- **Docker Swarm (7 tools, Komodo v2)** — Manage Swarm clusters end-to-end: list/info, list nodes, list services, create/update/delete, plus a single `komodo_swarm_action` covering node updates and removal of nodes / services / stacks.
- **Variables (4 tools)** — Manage Komodo Variables and Secrets. `apply` handles both create and update of value, description and the `is_secret` flag.
- **Resource Syncs (5 tools)** — Manage Komodo's GitOps-style ResourceSyncs: list/info, run, refresh and create/update/delete.
- **Update audit log (2 tools, read-only)** — Query the global Komodo Update log with server-side filtering by `operation`, `target_type` and `target_id`, paginated through the standard cursor envelope.

#### Smarter, leaner responses

- **Ephemeral resource links** — `komodo_container_inspect`, `komodo_container_logs`, `komodo_container_search_logs`, `komodo_server_info`, `komodo_deployment_info`, `komodo_stack_info` and most `info` tools now register their full payload as a session-scoped `ephemeral://…` resource. The text response shrinks to a one-line pointer; the assistant can fetch the full payload on demand via `resources/read`. Pass `inline_full: true` to keep the legacy inline behavior. Stateless clients automatically fall back to inlining — nothing breaks.
- **Cursor-based pagination** on every list tool (`{ cursor?, page_size? }`, 1–100, default 50) with a `page: { next_cursor?, total }` envelope. The Markdown renderer appends a clear footer when more results exist.
- **Typed `structuredContent` on every read and state-change tool** — Per the MCP 2025-06-18 "Structured Content" recommendation, modern clients receive a validated typed payload alongside the human-readable Markdown. This includes 11 read tools, every `*_action`, every `*_apply`, every `*_delete`, plus `komodo_exec`, `komodo_health_check`, `komodo_configure`, `komodo_user_list_api_keys`, `komodo_user_create_api_key` and `komodo_user_delete_api_key`.
- **Rich Markdown formatting** — Bullet lists with state badges (`✅ Running`, `🟡 Paused`, `❌ Exited`), embedded JSON for inspect/info, fenced code blocks for logs and exec output, and multi-line action results showing `Status`, `Update ID`, `Version` plus the most relevant log excerpts (last two stages on success, all failed/stderr stages on failure).

#### Operability

- **`_meta.category` on every tool** — One of 16 categories. MCP clients and gateways can filter or group tools by category.
- **`requiredScopes` on every tool** — Three-tier RBAC (`komodo:read` / `komodo:operate` / `komodo:admin`). Currently passive (Komodo has no OIDC yet); the framework's scope filter will activate automatically once tokens carry scopes.
- **New environment variables** for the resource-link cache: `KOMODO_RESOURCE_TTL_INFO` (default `15m`), `KOMODO_RESOURCE_TTL_LOGS` (default `2m`) and `KOMODO_RESOURCE_MAX_ENTRIES` (default `1000`). Logs use a shorter TTL because of their volatility.

### Changed (Breaking)

- **Tool naming** — All tools were renamed to `komodo_<domain>_<action>`. Examples: `komodo_list_containers` → `komodo_container_list`, `komodo_get_server_info` → `komodo_server_info`, `komodo_create_api_key` → `komodo_user_create_api_key`. See **Migration** below.
- **Lifecycle consolidation** — Per-verb container/stack/deployment/repo lifecycle tools were collapsed into a single `*_action` tool per domain with an `action` discriminator. `komodo_container_action` covers `start` / `stop` / `restart` / `pause` / `unpause`; `komodo_stack_action` and `komodo_deployment_action` cover `deploy` / `pull` / `start` / `restart` / `pause` / `unpause` / `stop` / `destroy`; `komodo_repo_action` covers `clone` / `pull` / `build` / `cancel_build`.
- **CRUD consolidation (`*_apply`)** — `komodo_<domain>_create` and `komodo_<domain>_update` were merged into `komodo_<domain>_apply` with `{ action: "create" | "update" }` for `server`, `stack`, `deployment`, `build`, `repo`, `procedure`, `swarm` and the new domains (Action, Alerter, ResourceSync, Variable). 14 tools became 7.
- **Build run/cancel consolidation** — `komodo_build_run` and `komodo_build_cancel` merged into `komodo_build_action`.
- **Procedure run consolidation** — `komodo_procedure_run` renamed to `komodo_procedure_action` for naming consistency.
- **Terminal consolidation** — `komodo_server_exec`, `komodo_container_exec`, `komodo_deployment_exec` and `komodo_stack_service_exec` merged into a single `komodo_exec` tool with a `target` discriminator (`server` / `container` / `deployment` / `stack_service`).
- **Prune relocation** — The standalone `komodo_prune` tool is gone. Pruning is now part of `komodo_server_action`, alongside the new batch container ops (`start_all_containers`, `restart_all_containers`, `pause_all_containers`, `unpause_all_containers`, `stop_all_containers`), the full prune family (`prune_containers` / `prune_images` / `prune_volumes` / `prune_networks` / `prune_system` / `prune_docker_builders` / `prune_buildx`) and named-resource deletion (`delete_network` / `delete_image` / `delete_volume`). All require `komodo:admin`.

### Fixed

- **`komodo_exec` no longer leaves an orphan rejected promise on auth failure ([#124](https://github.com/MP-Tool/komodo-mcp-server/pull/124))** — When an API key lacked the `Terminal` permission, the exec helper produced a second, unhandled rejection alongside the real error. Cleanup now runs through a single `.finally()` chain so the side-channel rejection no longer exists. Thanks to @puigru for the report and original patch.
- **`KomodoClient.login()` timer leak ([#125](https://github.com/MP-Tool/komodo-mcp-server/issues/125))** — The login timeout's `setTimeout` was never cleared after the race resolved, keeping the process alive for up to `API_TIMEOUT_MS` longer than necessary and risking an unhandled rejection on a late timer fire. The timer is now cleared in `finally` on both the success and error paths.

### Removed

- **Builder tools (4 tools)** — `komodo_builder_list`, `komodo_builder_info`, `komodo_builder_apply` and `komodo_builder_delete` were removed. In Komodo v2, Builders are conceptually Komodo Servers/Nodes — the dedicated tools added duplicate surface without operational value. Use `komodo_server_*` instead.

### Dependencies

- Bumped `mcp-server-framework` from `^1.0.5` to `^1.1.0` for the new `structured()` response helper, typed `output` schemas on `defineTool()`, the dynamic resource registry powering `ephemeral://…` links, and per-call resource read context.

### Migration

The renames and consolidations are breaking. Update any client prompts, scripts or AI assistant instructions that hard-code old tool names.

- **Renames** — Replace `komodo_list_*` / `komodo_get_*` / `komodo_*_container` calls with the new `komodo_<domain>_<action>` names. Examples: `komodo_list_containers` → `komodo_container_list`, `komodo_get_server_info` → `komodo_server_info`, `komodo_create_api_key` → `komodo_user_create_api_key`.
- **Lifecycle (`*_action`)** — Replace per-verb container/stack/deployment/repo tools with the consolidated `*_action` tool. Example: `komodo_repo_clone` → `komodo_repo_action` with `{ action: "clone", repo: "<id-or-name>" }`.
- **CRUD (`*_apply`)** — Replace `*_create` / `*_update` with `*_apply`:
  - Create: `{ action: "create", name: "<name>", config: { … } }`
  - Update: `{ action: "update", <domain>: "<id-or-name>", config: { … } }` (e.g. `server: "prod-1"`, `stack: "my-stack"`)
- **Builds** — `komodo_build_run` and `komodo_build_cancel` → `komodo_build_action` with `{ action: "run" | "cancel", build: "<id-or-name>" }`.
- **Terminal** — `komodo_server_exec` / `komodo_container_exec` / `komodo_deployment_exec` / `komodo_stack_service_exec` → `komodo_exec` with `{ target: "server" | "container" | "deployment" | "stack_service", … }`.
- **Prune** — `komodo_prune` → `komodo_server_action` with `{ action: "prune_containers" | "prune_images" | … }`.
- **Builders** — Tools removed. Use `komodo_server_list` / `komodo_server_info` / `komodo_server_apply` for the underlying Komodo Server resource.

--------------------------------------------------------------

## [1.3.2] - Quality & Maintenance

### Dependencies

- Updated `komodo_client` to 2.1.1 with latest API improvements
- Updated all other dependencies to their latest versions for security and stability

--------------------------------------------------------------

## [1.3.1] - Improved Progress Reporting & Connection Stability

### Improved

- **Real-time operation stages**: Deploy, start, stop and other long-running operations now show exactly what Komodo is doing (e.g. "Pulling Image", "Starting Container") instead of a generic timer — you always know what's happening
- **Better progress bars in terminal tools**: Remote command execution now shows proper progress indicators compatible with all MCP clients
- **Live log streaming to AI client**: During tool execution, server logs are automatically forwarded to the AI assistant — the AI sees what's going on behind the scenes for better troubleshooting
- **SSE streaming enabled by default**: Progress updates, log messages, and operation status are now reliably delivered during tool execution (previously could be silently dropped in JSON response mode)
- **Stable connections behind proxies**: Long-running connections are kept alive with periodic heartbeats — no more random disconnects when using reverse proxies, load balancers, or cloud deployments

### Fixed

- **Docker startup with missing config file**: The server no longer crashes if `MCP_CONFIG_FILE_PATH` points to a file that doesn't exist yet (e.g. Docker volume not mounted). It now starts gracefully with a warning and uses environment variables only
- **Noisy AI client notifications**: Removed unnecessary debug-level notifications that were being forwarded to the AI client, reducing clutter in the conversation

### Security

- Hardened CI/CD pipeline against supply-chain attacks (pinned dependencies, reproducible builds)
- Added automated code scanning for common security patterns (OWASP)
- Improved rate limiting, clickjacking protection, and regex safety in the underlying framework

### Dependencies

- Updated `mcp-server-framework` to v1.0.5

--------------------------------------------------------------

## [1.3.0]

### Added

- **Live progress reporting**: Long-running operations (deploy, start, stop, restart, etc.) now report progress updates to the AI client in real time — no more silent waiting
- **Cancellation support**: All lifecycle operations can be cancelled mid-flight — the AI client can abort running deployments, stack operations, or container actions at any time
- **Richer operation results**: Completed operations now include success/failure status, version info, and relevant log output directly in the response — faster diagnosis without separate log queries
- **Stack file dependencies**: Full support for Komodo v2 stack file dependencies with service mappings and cross-stack requires
- **Environment file tracking**: Stack environment files now support the `track` flag for change detection
- **Compose wrapper includes**: New `compose_cmd_wrapper_include` field for selective compose command wrapping

- **Remote command execution**: Run shell commands directly on servers, inside containers, deployments, and stack services — diagnose issues, run maintenance tasks, or check application state without leaving the AI conversation
- **Live output with progress**: Terminal output streams back in real time with progress updates — long-running commands show what's happening instead of going silent
- **API key management**: List, create, and delete API keys for the currently authenticated user — manage access credentials directly through the AI assistant

- **Three authentication methods**: Support for API Key, JWT Token, and Username/Password authentication — choose the method that fits your setup
- **JWT Token support**: Use pre-existing JWT tokens from browser-based logins (OIDC, GitHub, Google OAuth) to authenticate without storing credentials
- **Automatic connection on startup**: When credentials are configured via environment variables or config file, the server connects to Komodo automatically at launch — no manual `komodo_configure` call needed
- **Connection monitoring with auto-reconnect**: Periodic health checks detect connection loss and automatically re-establish the connection with exponential backoff
- **Login method discovery**: The `komodo_configure` tool queries available login methods (local, GitHub, Google, OIDC) from the Komodo server and displays them for informational purposes
- **Auth rejection detection**: Authentication failures (invalid credentials, expired tokens, unknown users) are clearly distinguished from network errors and reported with actionable messages
- **Error extraction utilities**: Komodo API errors are parsed and formatted into human-readable messages with proper error classification

- **Complete configuration reference**: New `config/` directory with a central reference guide and ready-to-use example configs (TOML, YAML, .env) — every setting documented in one place so you can get started without guessing environment variable names
- **Copy-and-customize config templates**: Just copy `example.config.toml` (or YAML/.env) into your project, adjust the values, and you're done — no more searching through docs for the right variable names
- **Streamlined Docker deployment**: New `docker/` directory with a step-by-step guide, ready-to-use `compose.yaml`, and preconfigured `.env` template — get a production-ready container running in minutes with just `docker compose up -d`
- **Node.js / npx setup guide**: New `examples/node/` guide for running the server natively without Docker — covers npx, global install, and platform-specific instructions for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Improved client integration guides**: Overhauled setup guides for Claude Desktop and VS Code / GitHub Copilot with clearer steps and updated example configs
- **Refreshed README**: Cleaner feature overview, streamlined quick start, and better navigation to all documentation and integration guides

- **Modernized DevContainer**: Faster container startup with lighter `postCreateCommand`, correct port forwarding (8000), Prettier and TypeScript SDK preconfigured — just open in VS Code and start coding
- **Improved MCP Registry metadata**: Richer server.json with repository verification, Docker runtime hints, and input placeholders — MCP clients can display better setup guidance and verify package integrity

### Changed

- **komodo_client v2.0.0 Auth API**: Migrated authentication calls to namespaced API (`auth.login()`, `auth.manage()`) — supports `JwtOrTwoFactor` discriminated union response with explicit 2FA rejection
- **Login options**: `getLoginOptions()` now includes `registration_disabled` field from Komodo v2
- **Connection architecture**: Unified connection management — a single `KomodoConnection` class handles client lifecycle, authentication, health monitoring, and reconnect logic
- **Configure tool**: Richer feedback on connection status including Komodo version, health check results, and available login methods
- **Health check tool**: Reports detailed connection state including server version, MCP server version, and clear status indicators
- **Credential configuration**: Support for Docker secrets (`*_FILE` env vars), config file (`[komodo]` section), and direct environment variables with clear priority chain
- **Environment variable naming**: `KOMODO_JWT_TOKEN` (was `KOMODO_JWT_SECRET`) — clearly identifies the value as a token, not a signing key
- **Validation error handling**: Invalid tool inputs (e.g. multiple auth methods) return clean MCP error responses with server-side warning logs instead of unhandled exceptions

### Fixed

- **localStorage crash on startup**: Added temporary polyfill for `localStorage` in Node.js — `mogh_auth_client` (transitive dependency of `komodo_client` v2) calls `localStorage.getItem()` at module load, which crashes in Node.js 22+ where `localStorage` exists but has no methods without `--localstorage-file`

### Removed

- Framework's `ConnectionStateManager` dependency — connection management is now fully self-contained

### Dependencies

- Updated `komodo_client` to v2.0.0
- Updated `mcp-server-framework` to v1.0.3

--------------------------------------------------------------

## [1.2.2] - Docker Security & Build Optimization

### 🔐 Security

- **Hardened Runtime User**: Use built-in `node` user (UID 1000) with `/sbin/nologin` shell
  - No interactive login possible for the service account
  - Replaces custom `komodo` user for better security alignment with base image
- **Immutable Build Artifacts**: Build files owned by `root:root`, runtime user cannot modify them
  - `node_modules/` and `build/` are read-only for the application
- **Tini Init System**: Added [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini) as PID 1 for proper signal handling
  - Ensures graceful shutdown on SIGTERM
  - Prevents zombie processes
- **Signed Git Tags**: Release tags are now cryptographically signed via GitHub API
  - Annotated tags with release notes for better traceability

### ✨ New Features

- **ARM/v6 Support**: Added 32-bit ARMv6 architecture (Raspberry Pi Zero/1)
  - Docker images now available for: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/arm/v7`, `linux/arm/v6`

### 📦 Improvements

- **Healthcheck: curl → wget**: Replaced `curl` with `wget --spider` for healthchecks
  - `wget` is included in Alpine (BusyBox) - no additional package installation needed
  - `--spider` performs HEAD request only (more efficient)
- **Optimized Docker Build**: Reduced unnecessary steps and improved layer caching
  - Copy only `src/` and `tsconfig*.json` instead of entire context
  - Removed `curl` dependency from production stage
  - Combined multiple `LABEL` statements into one
- **Build Metadata**: Embedded VERSION, BUILD_DATE, and COMMIT_SHA into container
  - Files available at `/app/build/VERSION`, `/app/build/BUILD_DATE`, `/app/build/COMMIT_SHA`
  - OCI labels include version, created date, and revision
- **GHCR Metadata Fix**: Added `DOCKER_METADATA_ANNOTATIONS_LEVELS: manifest,index` to CI
  - Fixes missing description in GitHub Container Registry for multi-arch images
- **Release Workflow Cleanup**: Removed separate attestation images from GHCR
  - Provenance and SBOM are now embedded directly in image manifest
  - Cleaner registry without `sha-*` tagged attestation artifacts

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **CI Annotations**: Multi-arch images now correctly display metadata in GHCR package page
- **OpenSSF Signed-Releases**: Export SLSA attestations as GitHub Release assets
  - Enables OpenSSF Scorecard to verify signed releases
  - Attestations available as `attestations.intoto.jsonl` in each release

### ⬆️ Dependencies

- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`: 1.25.2 → 1.26.0
- `@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node`: 0.68.0 → 0.69.0

## [1.2.1] - Minojr Bug Fixes

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Docker ARM64 Build**: Fixed QEMU emulation failure during ARM64 cross-compilation
  - Moved `npm prune --omit=dev` to builder stage to avoid running npm in production stage under QEMU
  - Production stage now copies pre-pruned `node_modules` from builder instead of running `npm ci`
  - Resolves "Illegal instruction (core dumped)" error on ARM64 builds

- **Version Resolution in Docker**: Fixed server failing to start with "Server version is required" error
  - Version is now baked into `build/VERSION` during Docker build from `package.json`
  - Single Source of Truth: `package.json` → immutable once image is built
  - Fallback chain: `build/VERSION` → `npm_package_version` → `package.json`

### ✨ New Features

- **ARM/v7 Support**: Added 32-bit ARM architecture support (Raspberry Pi 3, older ARM devices)
- Docker images now available for: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/arm/v7`

### 📦 Improvements

- **Dockerfile Optimization**: Improved multi-stage build with better documentation and layer caching
- **Build Performance**: Production stage no longer runs npm operations, reducing build time and complexity
- **Removed VERSION Build-Arg**: Version is now extracted from `package.json` during build, not passed as argument

--------------------------------------------------------------

- `/ready` - Smart readiness with accurate status codes:
  - `200` - Ready to accept traffic
  - `503` - Komodo configured but not connected
  - `429` - Session limits reached

#### Legacy SSE Transport
- Enable with `MCP_LEGACY_SSE_ENABLED=true`
- Supports older MCP clients using protocol 2024-11-05
- Both modern Streamable HTTP and legacy SSE can run simultaneously

### 🔧 Improvements
